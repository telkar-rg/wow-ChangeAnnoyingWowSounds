# Change Annoying WoW Sounds
WotLK Addon/files to stop/change annoying WoW sounds

### How does it work?
In your`<WoW Install Folder>` you have / can create a folder named `Sound`. If you place Sound Files of correct file name in the corect subfolder, the game will use these sound files instead of the default game sound files. This can be used in general to modify your Game Audio Experience, and in specific to mute or change particular annoying game sounds.

### Installation
- Extract your downloaded zip-file.
- Copy/move the files from `<Download Location>/CAWS-XXX/Sound` to `<WoW Install Folder>/Sound`.

*If you have already existing files in the `Sound` folder, back them up beforehand in case you might overwrite them and don't want to lose them!*
