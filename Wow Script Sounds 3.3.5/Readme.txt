v2.0 updated for Patch 3.1. Uldaur sounds are in the "3_1_sounds.txt" file

v2.1 Changed Carriage returns to Windows style. So it now opens in Note Pad :D
:D :D . Thanks Verissi :D

v2.2 Woops forgot some 3.1 sounds. Missed an entire MPQ! . Thanks Mordroth

v2.3 Complete re-extract for 3.1.2. Now updated for 3.1.2. Has baby murloc space
marine sounds :D.As a side note looks like Blizzard only uses wav files and mp3
files for their sounds :D

v3.2 Updated for 3.2. Going to do complete re-extracts from now on to ensure I
get all sounds. Also using new version numbering system to make things easier on
myself:)

v3.2.1 Much help from Eisa in getting Creature\LichKing sounds properly
extracted. Had to relearn how to do this lol. Also reworked version history

v3.3 Updated for 3.3. 20,491 total sounds , +1618 from last update . As a side
note your Data folder is 25.4 GB fully extracted

v3.3.2 Updated for 3.3.2 That one that finally unlocks the lich king wing of ICC
! Total unique sounds now up to 20,653 +162 since last update.

v3.3.3 Updated for patch 3.3.3 Looks like they've put in some sounds for Ruby
Sanctum , the new gnomes & trolls get their own home cities patch as there is an
extra 403 sounds in this update. 21,056 total sounds now

v3.3.5 Updated for patch 3.3.5  Not many sounds in this update only about 18
sounds bringing the total up to 21,074. This author is badly in need of sleep
*snoozes on nearest available flat surface* zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
*starts drooling in his sleep* O_O 

About this file

Well it's here. As far as I know this should contain every sound in
World of Warcraft. All you need to do is to do a find for the NPC you
want to play the sounds for then copy that line and paste it in when
logged into World of Warcraft. I've done a random spot check of most of
the sounds and most of them are working. Of course let me know if they
aren't (on the UI & Macros forum on the World of Warcraft site). Please
note I'm not sure how different the path locations are for other
localisations - I did this with the US English version , locale enUS.
